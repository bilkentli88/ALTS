# ALTS: Advanced Learning-based Time Series Classification

![ALTS Logo](https://your-logo-link.com/logo.png) *(Optional)*

## Overview

**ALTS (Advanced Learning-based Time Series Classification)** is a powerful framework designed for time series classification tasks. It leverages the concept of shapelets—discriminative subsequences of time series data—to build interpretable and highly accurate models. ALTS is built with flexibility in mind, allowing users to apply it to a wide range of time series datasets with minimal effort.

Key features of ALTS include:
- **Shapelet Learning**: Automatically learns shapelets (key patterns) from time series data.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Utilizes Optuna for efficient hyperparameter tuning, ensuring optimal model performance.
- **Regularization Techniques**: Incorporates advanced regularization methods like L2 and Fused Lasso to prevent overfitting and enhance model generalization.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend and adapt to different time series datasets and classification tasks.

## Installation

To get started with ALTS, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ALTS.git
cd ALTS
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Preprocessing Data
Before training models, you need to preprocess your time series data. ALTS includes utilities for loading, normalizing, and augmenting datasets:

python
Copy code
from process_datasets import load_dataset

# Load and preprocess the dataset
train_features, train_labels, test_features, test_labels = load_dataset('YourDatasetName')
Training Models
ALTS uses Optuna for hyperparameter optimization to find the best model configuration for your dataset. Here’s how to run the optimization process:

bash
Copy code
python get_train_results.py --dataset YourDatasetName
This script will:

Retrieve the dataset.
Perform hyperparameter optimization using Optuna.
Save the best hyperparameters and corresponding model performance.
Evaluating Models
After finding the best hyperparameters, you can evaluate the model on a test set:

python
Copy code
from optimize_shapelets import get_test_results_for_one_dataset

get_test_results_for_one_dataset(
    search_type="OptunaSearch",
    dataset_name="YourDatasetName",
    n_trials=100,
    search_max_epoch=1000,
    test_result_max_epoch=1000
)
Hyperparameters
ALTS allows for the tuning of several key hyperparameters:

n_prototypes: Number of shapelets to learn.
bag_size: Length of each shapelet.
lambda_prototypes: Regularization strength for L2 regularization on shapelets.
lambda_fused_lasso: Regularization strength for Fused Lasso regularization.
stride_ratio: Ratio of stride to bag size for creating overlapping subsequences (bags).
dropout_rate: Dropout rate for regularization within the neural network.
These hyperparameters can be adjusted in the Optuna search process to optimize model performance.
